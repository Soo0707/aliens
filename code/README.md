Footnote
The map provided is just a regular Tiled map made with 32x32 tiles and can be replaced so long as all expected layers are present.
The start menu is baked into the map but spawn location can be changed by modifying spawn.txt in the map folder where the first line is the X-coordinate and second line is the Y-coordinate. Just be sure to change the Start and Exit tiles in the map as well.

The game is bundled for Windows but Proton on Linux works.
The game must be launched with the asset folder beside it, i.e. in the same folder/directory.
